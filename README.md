### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- First 3 cars were decently readable from a glance
- All except the Prius had the speedometer very accessible
- Some had small LCD screens with movable menus to show more information than lights can show
- Good use of colors, non-distracting RGB and use of red to show "Danger Zones"

Cons:
- Prius and Multipla were difficult to quickyly gleen information from
- F150 has didecated gauges to things I'm unsure one would need, might be biased as I do not drive a truck
- Some warning lights are small and easy to ignore
- Multipla tries to have everything within an arms reach of the driver, ends up being busy and distracting

## Common / Rare Features, and Suggestions

Common:
- Read Speed
- Read RPM
- Read engine temperature

Suggestions:

- Easy to read speedometer that's distingushable from the tachometer
- Only show information that the driver would need while driving
